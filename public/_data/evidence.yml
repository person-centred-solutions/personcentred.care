    The use of PCC in the group of patients with hip fractures reduced the number of days of care
    by 50 percent and reduced the number of medical complications and the level of pain experienced
    by patients. The same study showed that the highest improvement was achieved in the oldest
    patients. In the 91–97 age group, the number of days of care decreased from 46 days to 12 days,
    compared to the age group 65–70 years in which the number of days of care was reduced from
    16 to 14 days

- title: Compliance
  caption: |
    Patients' failure to comply with the recommendations of medical professionals is a crucial
    issue of modern healthcare, especially in the post-acute treatment period. Coronary artery
    disease is a clear example of this issue — despite the significant mortality decrease achieved
    by the invasive medicine, the overall effects are destroyed by the lack of subsequent
    rehabilitation, mainly because only a small percentage of patients participate in it

    prophylactic advice regarding physical activity, healthy eating, smoking, and maintaining
    adequate cholesterol levels. Similarly, the application of PCC brings measurable effects in
    this area
