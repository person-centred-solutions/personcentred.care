      The use of PCC in the group of patients with hip fractures reduced the number of days of care
      by 50 percent and reduced the number of medical complications and the level of pain experienced
      by patients. The same study showed that the highest improvement was achieved in the oldest
      patients. In the 91–97 age group, the number of days of care decreased from 46 days to 12 days,
      compared to the age group 65–70 years in which the number of days of care was reduced from
      16 to 14 days
