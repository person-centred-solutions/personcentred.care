Person-Centred Care (PCC) means a step forward from well-established approach called Patient-Centred Care. The Picker Institute, identified eight characteristics of care as the most important indicators of Patient-Centred Care<sup>[1]</sup>:

1. respect for the patient’s values, preferences, and expressed needs;
2. coordinated and integrated care;
3. clear, high-quality information and education for the patient and family;
4. physical comfort, including pain management;
5. emotional support and alleviation of fear and anxiety;
6. involvement of family members and friends, as appropriate;
7. continuity, including through care-site transitions;
8. and access to care.
   The most important omission in the list is partnership between a patient, their family and healthcare professionals. Thus, Person-Centred Care is shift from a model of care based on diagnoses and one side physician judgement to an approach based on a contractual agreement between a patient, their family and medical professionals. PCC involves the patient as an active partner in care and the decision-making process. Patients and health care professionals jointly develop a health plan based on the patient´s illness history which identifies personal resources and opportunities in the home and social network as well as potential barriers. Identified resources together with medical examinations and bio-markers form the foundation for elaborating the jointly agreed care plan <sup>[2]</sup>.
   In Patient-Centred Care a patient is in the centre of the care process but is not an equal partner in their own care and treatment.

In Person-Centred Care in the centre are “patient’s goals, capabilities and expectations” and the patient is an equal partner together health care professionals in the decision-making process concerning their care. This idea does not imply that patients and professionals take on the same roles and responsibilities as in a negotiation between equals. The fundamental equality and asymmetry between patient and professional implies that their relationship cannot be a matter of a one-way exercise of power, but neither a symmetrical exchange of information. Establishing a partnership requires an active involvement from both parties, but from different starting points and with different prerequisites. The professional is an expert in medicine, rehabilitation, care etc. and the patient is an expert on their own life, fillings and desires. Person-centred care (PCC) addresses the importance of knowing the person behind the patient.
There are many centres in Europe and the US where PCC is developed. One of the most prominent is the University of Gothenburg Centre for Person-Centred Care (GPCC) (https://gpcc.gu.se/english). The GPCC model consists of three essential ‘routines’ to initiate, integrate and safeguard person-centred care in daily clinical practice [3]:

1. **Patient narrative**. The first routine serves to initiate a partnership by eliciting the patient narrative - a sick person’s account of their illness, symptoms and their impact on their life. It captures the person’s suffering in the context of their everyday life, as an equal addition to medical narratives that reflect the process of diagnosing and treating the disease.
2. **Partnership**. The second routine serves to work the partnership by means of shared decision making, so that professionals, patients and very often their relatives all work together to achieve commonly agreed goals.
3. **Documentation**. The third routine serves to safeguard the partnership by documenting the narrative in the form of patient preferences and values, as well as involvement in care and treatment decision making.
   These routines lead to jointly agreed care plan which have to embrace <sup>[3]</sup>:
   • clinical tasks to be undertaken by the professionals and
   • everyday goals undertaken by the patient/relatives.

### Questions identifying a person-centred care

when most of the answers to the following questions are positive than one can consider that delivered care is consistent with person-centred care approach <sup>[2][3][4][5]</sup>:

1. Do professionals and therapeutic teams plan care and treatment together with patients and their relatives and make key decisions together?
2. Do professionals ask about patient preferences (both treatment preferences and the goals of treatment)?
3. Do professionals listen to the patient's narrative about their life and environment, often in the presence of their family, and on this basis identify their psychophysical state, hierarchy of values, ideas and thoughts regarding the improvement of their life and document it?
4. Do professionals understand the patient as a person in a socio-cultural context and identify their individual (and their social network) opportunities and limitations.
5. Are the identified opportunities and limitations used to better transform the resources provided by health care to strengthen the functionalities desired by the person?
6. Do professionals and patients (together with relatives) work as partners in the process of care and/or treatment and/or rehabilitation?
7. Does cooperation with professionals allow patients a sense of control over their care and/or treatment and/or rehabilitation?
8. Are people with low levels of activation, self-efficacy or faith in self-management of their care and/or treatment and/or rehabilitation supported in order to develop knowledge, skills and self-confidence to manage their health and well-being?
9. By listening to the patient's narrative, does the professional identify the needs and abilities in self-care and preventive care, focusing on the patient's available strengths to promote healthy behaviours?
10. Is the professional always seeking agreement on a care and treatment plan based on ethics?
11. Is the jointly prepared care and/or treatment and/or rehabilitation plan documented?
12. Is the current version of this plan always available to the patient?
13. Are the changes introduced in the patient's life discussed at the next meeting?
